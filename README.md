An interesting, theory-based, cryptography challenge featured in the FCSC 2021 CTF (French cybersecurity challenge), where the aim was to compute the discrete logarithm with an elliptic curve over a ring. Being more in the theoritical side of cryptography, it had few solves during the challenge, so I'm sharing a solution I came with during the event.
